# CTA Flow

## Primary CTA (cold traffic)

**Request Early Access**

Route to a short form:

- Email
- Role
- Use case

## Secondary CTA (warm traffic)

**See How It Works**

Route to a short walkthrough (2-3 screens):

1. Pipeline
2. Decision logic
3. Example result

## Trust CTA (enterprise or research traffic)

**Talk to Us**

Route to a use-case conversation, not a sales push.

## Post-CTA Confirmation

> We do not promise discoveries.
> We certify whether they are justified.

## Usage Notes

- Use one one-screen landing
- Place FAQ directly below the landing content
- Keep one primary CTA
- Avoid exaggerated claims
