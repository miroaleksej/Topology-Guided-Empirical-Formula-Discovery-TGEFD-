# One-Screen Landing

## Hero

### Headline

**Certify Structure. Reject Noise.**

### Subheadline

Topology-certified validation for empirical and ML models.

### One-liner

TGEFD determines whether a **stable empirical structure exists** in your data -
or certifies that it does not.

## Problem

Your tools always find patterns.
But they do not tell you **whether those patterns are real or just noise**.

Accuracy is not proof.
Fit is not stability.

## Solution

**TGEFD is a structure certification engine.**

It accepts a model **only if it forms a stable family** under perturbations and noise.
Otherwise, the result is formally rejected.

## How It Works

1. Explore a hypothesis space
2. Build sparse empirical models
3. Test *topological stability* under noise
4. **Certify: structure present or absent**

No heuristics. No cherry-picking.

## Output

Not just a model - a **decision**:

```text
STRUCTURE: PRESENT / ABSENT
STABILITY SCORE: 0.83
EVIDENCE: Topological invariants
```

Every run is reproducible and auditable.

## Why It Matters

- Prevents false discoveries
- Rejects unstable models before deployment
- Makes negative results explicit and defensible

## Positioning

TGEFD does **not** discover universal laws.
It certifies **empirical stability within a hypothesis class**.

## Final CTA

**Stop trusting noise.**
**Request Early Access**
